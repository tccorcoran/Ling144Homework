./campusrocks contains the ablation experiemnt run on campusrocks server. Only files needed for evaluation are here, the code for gathering features is in ./local_context. The features were grouped by POS tag. IN, WDT, WP, WDT were the most useful features in increasingly more informative order; however, WDT is far and away the most useful class.

./campusrocks/results/avg contains results for averages of each 10-fold X-eval for each portion of the ablation study. 

./campusrocks/results/per_fold contains resuts for each fold

./campusrocks/evaluate.py is the software that implements the ML and writes the results files

./campusrocks/feature_files contains feature files generated by getFeatures in the local_context dir


./local_context/code/ contains files for generating features, generting feature files for ablation, and running ML experiments, including grid search

./local_context/results/ contains the folders +2-2 and +3-3 which are the results from a context window of bi and trigrams. There is no sigificant difference between bi and trigrams

./local_context/results/gridSearch.cPickle results from a grid search

./local_context/data/ contains segmented data a 10% dev set and and 90% train/test set
